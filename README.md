> A small, fast, javascript DICOM renderer

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dicom.js.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dicom.js) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)


# background
Was in need to display greyscale, single frame dicom files as quickly as possible in the browser.  Cornerstone just seemed too big and complex for the task.

This is the result!

## Todo
- make sure adhere to licenses...
- fix microbundle warnings
- fix cornerstone comparison example
- add standalone React canvas example
- add test framework
- palette conversion does not work see ./test/issues
- some images are not perfect with cornerstone
- ll decoder can be slower than cornerstones
- seperate out decoders from parser
- currently only supports rendering frame 0!
- accelerate palette conversion


## Install

```bash
npm install --save dicom.js
```

## Usage

fix this:
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import DICOMCanvas from 'dicom.js'
import 'dicom.js/dist/index.css'

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <MyComponent />
  }
}
```
